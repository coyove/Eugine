	<div>Temp News is an experimental project created to test the reliability of my toy language, Eugine.</div>

	<div>TN stores data in files and it's very slow even on an SSD. Besides the HTTP server is thread-based, which consumes CPU and memory greatly. Running on a 1024 linode with -Xmx256m, server can roughly handle 50~60 rps (GET /?after=0). On an i5-5200U laptop with -Xmx2g and 7200rpm HDD requesting the same page, the result is around 200 rps.</div>

	<div>HTTP reading (java.net.ServerSocket) and parsing code is made from scratch without 3rd libraries, exceptions throwed by the socket are not suppressed, use (try ...) if necessary.</div>
